# Problem Statement

According to the UNHCR report Globally, refugees are 50 percent less likely than the general  population to have an Internet-capable phone. While 20 percent of rural refugees have no  access to connectivity, urban refugees often have access but cannot afford to get online. But these numbers shot higher during the Pandemic since most of the Physical aspects of  life were pushed to the virtual world, which includes education, social interaction, and livelihood  But as much as the internet can be a source of information and education content, it can also be  a source of Hate speech, cyber bullying and inhumane content that can affect the daily lives of  these refugees who many have yet little or no maximum knowledge of how to make it Amongst  the most affected users are girls of the age 15-35 who are mostly victims of cyberbullying and  illicit content on the internet By the availability of spaces like Platform Africa, CTEN innovation space, and other internet  providing spaces in Rhino camp refugee settlement internet penetration has hiked which comes  with the fear of the irresponsible use of the internet and hence a need for a civic education 

ICT for Girl Child (ICT4GC) seeks to address this challenge by educating the girlchild  community with skills on the responsible use of the internet to not only use it to develop  themselves but to rather become aware and act as advocates for the responsible use of the  internet

The project started with the implementation activities; Mobilization and identification of the participants, mobilization of resources, logistics and purchase which was done successfully by the colaborating partners.

Followed by the actual training/ mentorship activitie; 

1.	At the space at Platform Africa, the selected participants were taken through the introduction to the internet, what it is its power as a media tool and how they can maximize the use of the internet. 

2.	The responsible use of the internet; This involved notes and lessons taken from the field guide, and it helped the participants to understand the use of the internet in a responsible manner. 

3.	Social Media and Trauma; From a guide provided and created at Platform Africa, a session on how social media as a tool affects the mental health of the refugee girl child is a key aspect to discuss as well, here the participants were put into groups, they discussed their experience with the social media and shared their fears and expectations in form of presentation.

4.	 Internet for good; It  Summarized how best social and other websites and the internet as a whole can be maximized as a tool for social change. 

5.	A brief evaluation meeting was held immediately after the mentorship session by the collaborating partners at platform Africa. 

The final activity done was reporting which involed the findings from the participants feedback and partners evaluation.

From the point of view of the participants (target group) through the feedback mechnism and from the collaborting partners through the evaluation session, the project was successfully because the collaborating partners worked as a team.
